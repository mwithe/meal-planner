# Recipe Scraper
This personal project is an extension of a university assignment, exploring new technologies. Utilising the Python library BeautifulSoup to scrape recipes from a web page, the website allows users to add the ingredients of a recipe to their shopping list.

### To be implemented:
 - User auth
 - Database for storing user lists
 - Add user templates to lists (add bread, milk, 12 eggs etc. to the list automatically)
 - Aggregation of list ingredients (250g of chicken in one recipe, two chicken breasts in another recipe is 600g of Chicken in list.)

2. cd to cloned repository
3. cd .\backend\
4. Flask run
